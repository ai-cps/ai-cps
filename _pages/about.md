I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at University of California, Berkeley, co-advised by [Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alberto/) and [Kameshwar Poolla](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/poolla.html). I expect to receive my PhD degree in EECS in December 2020. Here is my [curriculum vitae](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--sPusICOCAQSRQ7OkQZnFj1tBwII08jhoWNpSgzn-0/edit?usp=sharing).

My research background lies in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), with a particular focus on uncertainty estimation and anomaly detection. My work has been focused on techniques for solving real-world problems in modern CPS (smart building systems, additive manufacturing systems) and healthcare AI (computer vision for medical image processing), and on understanding the theoretical underpinnings of such techniques.

Before coming to Berkeley, I received my bachelor degree from Peking University EECS Department, where I was very fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Guojie Luo](https://ceca.pku.edu.cn/en/people_/faculty_/guojie_luo/index.htm).

I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) at University of California, Berkeley. I obtained my PhD degree in EECS from the same department in December 2020. During my PhD study, I have been very fortunate to be co-advised by [Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alberto/) and [Kameshwar Poolla](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/poolla.html). During my PhD study, I received the inaugural *Lotfi A. Zadeh Prize* and the SinBerBEST *Outstanding Young Scientist* Award for my research work.

My research background lies in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), with a particular focus on uncertainty estimation and anomaly detection. My work has been focused on techniques for solving real-world problems in modern CPS (smart building systems, additive manufacturing systems) and healthcare AI (computer vision for medical image processing), and on understanding the theoretical underpinnings of such techniques.

Before coming to Berkeley, I obtained a B.Sc. degree from Peking University EECS Department, where I was very fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Guojie Luo](https://ceca.pku.edu.cn/en/people_/faculty_/guojie_luo/index.htm) on VLSI CAD algorithms.

Here is my [curriculum vitae](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--sPusICOCAQSRQ7OkQZnFj1tBwII08jhoWNpSgzn-0/edit?usp=sharing).

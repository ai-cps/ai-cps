I am currently a 6th-year PhD candidate at UC Berkeley, co-advised by [Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alberto/) and [Kameshwar Poolla](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/poolla.html). My research interests are in using machine learning algorithms to obtain insights about faults and anomalies in cyber-physical systems including HVAC and smart grids.

I got my bachelor degree from Peking University, where I conducted research on VLSI CAD under the guidance of [Guojie Luo](https://ceca.pku.edu.cn/en/people_/faculty_/guojie_luo/index.htm).

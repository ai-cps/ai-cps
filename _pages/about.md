I am a 6th-year PhD candidate with solid knowledge of algorithms, optimization, statistics, system design and verification, and with strong software development skills and experiences. My research interests are in using machine learning algorithms to obtain insights about faults and anomalies in cyber-physical systems such as HVAC and smart grid systems.

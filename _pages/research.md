## PhD Research

My PhD research is driven by my interest in applying machine learning algorithms to Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs).

## Other Research Projects

### Better demand response flexibility model 

### Common path pessimism removal in static timing analysis

### A better control strategy than "trim and response"

### Distributed system voltage control under uncertainties
